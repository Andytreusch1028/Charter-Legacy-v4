Charter Legacy: The Soul of the MachineVersion: 1.0 (Jobsian Revision)Status: Uncompromising1. The Core BeliefWe believe that the act of starting a company is an act of courage. The current legal "process" is a tax on that courage. It is slow, ugly, and designed by bureaucrats for bureaucrats. Charter Legacy exists to amplify the individual's potential by making the legal foundation of their dream as elegant as the product they intend to build.2. The "Step Three" KillIn the traditional folklore of LLC formation, the founder is forced to expose their home address or pay a "Registered Agent" tax immediately.The Old Way: Five steps, three signatures, 48 hours of confusion.The Charter Way: We default to the DeLand Hub Node. Total privacy by design. One click. Done.3. Product Hierarchy (The Gems)We have cut 70% of the noise. We focus only on:The LLC Masterpiece ($249): The complete vehicle. High-security, high-privacy.The DBA Magic Wand ($149): Automated transmission. No more "mailing checks" to newspapers.4. Visual PhilosophyPalette: Obsidian (#1D1D1F) and Legacy Blue (#007AFF).Haptics: Every click must feel substantial. If a user interacts with a "Succession Key," the interface should feel like turning a vault handle, not clicking a checkbox.Tone: Authority without Arrogance. We are the Librarian Scrivener. We provide the map; the founder drives the car.
