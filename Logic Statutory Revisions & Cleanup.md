Logic: Statutory Revisions & Cleanup (The Annual Report Window)1. The Opportunity: The Master SyncIn Florida, every LLC must file an Annual Report between January 1st and May 1st. Most founders view this as a bureaucratic chore. Charter Legacy treats this as a "Master Sync" event—a moment to audit the "Bicycle" and ensure all statutory gears are aligned.2. The "Cleanup" WorkflowDuring this window, the system allows the user to update critical entity data within the Annual Report interface:Principal Address: Update the DeLand Hub node or move to a private office.Mailing Address: Update where official notices are sent.Leadership (Article IV): Add/Remove Authorized Members (AMBR) or Managers (MGR).Registered Agent: Confirm or change the physical node responsible for Service of Process.3. Cost-Efficiency (Anti-Folklore)Filing a standalone "Statement of Change" or "Articles of Amendment" typically costs the user an additional $25.00 to $50.00 in state fees.The Strategy: We prioritize performing these updates within the Annual Report. The state does not charge extra for modifications made during the Annual Report filing. This saves the user money and prevents "Filing Fatigue."4. UI Execution: Side-by-Side AuditThe Dashboard must present a high-fidelity "Mirror" view:Left Side: Current Public Record (Sunbiz).Right Side: Proposed Charter Update (The Legacy Intent).Action: User confirms the sync, and the machine scrives the update into the Annual Report transmission.5. The "Late Fee" SentinelThe system is hard-coded to trigger "Emergency" visual states starting April 15th.Alert: "WARNING: The $400 Florida Late Fee Trap becomes active in 15 days."Goal: 100% compliance rate for all Charter Legacy members before the May 1st deadline.Institutional Directive: "Never pay for an amendment when you can sync for free. We protect the founder's capital as much as their privacy."
