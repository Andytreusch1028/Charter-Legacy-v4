## 1. **Founder's Shield** ($249) - 10/10 ✨

### Changes Made:

✅ **Renamed** from "Privacy LLC Package" to **"Founder's Shield"**  
✅ **Tagline added:** "Your LLC. Your privacy. Not your home address on Google."  
✅ **Value prop enhanced:** "The only LLC service that protects your home address by default"

### Steve's Verdict:

> **9/10 → 10/10** after name fix. "Founder's Shield is iconic. Ship it."

## 2. **Medical PLLC** ($499) - 10/10 ✨

### Changes Made:

✅ **Added Board License Status Monitor:**

- Pulls from FL Board of Medicine/Nursing/Dentistry/Pharmacy public databases
- Displays license status (active/inactive - factual only)
- Shows renewal date from state records
- 60-day renewal deadline alerts

### UPL-Safe Implementation:

> "Displays factual license status from public database only - no compliance opinion.  
> Example: 'Your FL medical license #12345 expires on [date].'"

### Steve's Verdict:

> **8/10 → 10/10** after adding license monitor. "Doctor losing license = $200K problem. You solve it for $499. That's a steal."

### Changes Made:

### Steve's Verdict:

> **6/10 → 9/10** after rename + helper. "The IDEA was good, the NAME was confusing. Fixed."

### UPL-Safe Implementation:

## Steve's Big Picture Insight

> **"Legacy Timer is your iPhone. Everything else is good products, but the Switch is the one that changes the game."**

**His prediction:** Legacy Timer will be what Charter Legacy is known for 10 years from now. The LLC products are great, but automatic successor access with no probate lawyer is the revolutionary feature.

**His advice:** Bet everything on making The Legacy Will insanely great.
