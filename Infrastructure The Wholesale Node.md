Infrastructure: The Wholesale Node Plan (v1.0)1. Executive SummaryTo launch Charter Legacy as an asset-light "High-Tech Scrivener," we decouple the clerical interface from the physical requirement. We utilize wholesale Registered Agent (RA) providers to serve as our initial physical nodes. This allows us to offer the "Privacy Shield" on Day 1 without owning real estate.2. The Phase 1 Wholesalers (Bootstrap)We have identified two primary partners that offer the API infrastructure required to power our "Magic Wand" backend:A. LegalInc (The Automation Choice)Strengths: Best-in-class API documentation. Designed specifically for software companies to "white-label" legal fulfillment.Role: Powers the high-volume automated submissions.Workflow: When a user clicks "Pay & Launch," Charter Legacy hits the LegalInc API. They handle the XML transmission to Sunbiz and provide the Registered Agent address.B. Northwest Registered Agent (The Premium Choice)Strengths: Known for "privacy-first" folklore and high-quality local scanning.Role: Ideal for the "Artisan" user who requires a more boutique touch or specialized mail handling.Workflow: Used for high-value entities where manual review of scanned mail is a priority.3. Mapping the "DeLand Hub" BrandOn the public Sunbiz record (Article II and III), the address listed will be the wholesaler's professional office. However, in the Charter Legacy UI, we frame this as the Charter Fulfillment Node.Front-end: "Your Privacy Shield is active at our Florida Fulfillment Node."Back-end: All statutory mail is scanned by the wholesaler and pushed to our PrivacyShieldDashboard.jsx via webhook.4. The "Hub" Evolution (The 250 Milestone)The wholesale model is a bridge, not a destination. We transition from "Renter" to "Anchor" based on volume:MilestoneStrategyAction0-250 Units100% WholesaleUtilize LegalInc/Northwest API.250-500 UnitsHybrid NodeSign a small commercial lease in DeLand, FL.

Cost & Margin AnalysisWholesale Cost: ~$35 - $50 / year per client.Charter Bundle Fee: $249 (includes the first year of RA).Strategic Subsidy: We treat the wholesaler cost as a "Customer Acquisition Cost" (CAC) to ensure we can offer the Privacy Shield for free in Year 1.6. Regulatory ComplianceBy using established wholesalers, we satisfy the F.S. 605.0113 requirement for a Registered Agent to be available during all "Normal Business Hours" (9am-5pm), offloading the physical compliance risk to the wholesale partner while we focus on the software experience.Directive: "Rent the dirt to build the bicycle. Own the dirt to build the factory."
