Operational SOP: Proof of Publication Acquisition (v1.0)1. Executive SummaryFlorida Statute 865.09 requires a one-time legal advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation. Traditionally, this involves manual "clipping" of newsprint. This protocol defines the Automated Acquisition Loop that retrieves the Electronic Proof of Publication (e-POP) from the Florida Press Association (FPA) aggregator.2. The Acquisition Loop (The Sentinel)The backend system must not wait for a human to upload a scan. It must actively hunt for the record.A. FrequencyInterval: Every 24 hours.Duration: Loop remains active for 45 days from the date of state filing.Trigger: Initiated instantly upon successful transmission of the legal notice to the FPA node.B. Target NodeAggregator: floridapublicnotices.comSearch Parameters: 1.  Entity Name (as scrived in Article I).2.  FPA Transaction ID (generated during DbaPublicationEngine execution).3.  County of Publication.3. Retrieval & Matching LogicA. Distinguished MatchingThe machine must verify that the notice content matches the Charter Intent:Identity Check: Does the "Fictitious Name" in the notice match the Sunbiz record exactly?Owner Check: Does the listed owner (Individual or LLC) match the scrived intent?B. Artifact ExtractionOnce a match is identified:Capture: Download the high-resolution PDF generated by the press aggregator.Metadata: Extract the Run Date, Newspaper Name, and Affidavit Number.4. The Legacy Vault Protocol (Tier 2)The retrieved proof is not just "saved"—it is Vaulted as an Institutional Artifact.Cryptographic Timestamping: Apply a local server-side timestamp to the PDF to prove time of acquisition.Naming Convention: EPOP_ENTITYNAME_COUNTY_YYYYMMDD.pdfTier Placement: Move to Tier 2 (Official Record) of the Legacy Vault.Notification: Dispatch a high-priority "Heartbeat" alert to the user's Mobile App: "Statutory Requirement Defused. Your Digital Affidavit of Publication is now vaulted."5. Failure & Manual Review (The Exception Node)If the loop reaches Day 40 without an acquisition:Escalation: Flag the record for manual review by the DeLand Hub Admin.User Status: Update the Pulse UI to: "Acquisition Latency Detected. Our Node is contacting the Press Association Administrator."Safety: Prevent the system from marking the DBA as "Fully Compliant" until the e-POP is cryptographically verified.Institutional Directive: "The user should never have to touch a newspaper. The machine is the witness; the Vault is the evidence."
