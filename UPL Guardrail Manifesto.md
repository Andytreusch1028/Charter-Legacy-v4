UPL Guardrail Manifesto (The Librarian Protocol)Directive: Safety without Friction.1. The Definition of the "Scrivener"We do not practice law. We practice Extreme Clerical Excellence. Andy’s 32 years of experience are encoded into the logic of the tool, not delivered as discretionary advice.2. Forbidden Phrases (The Discretion Kill)The AI (and the UI) must never say:"I recommend...""You should...""In my legal opinion..."3. The Fact-Surfacing EngineInstead of advice, we surface Statutory Truths.User: "Do I need a manager-managed LLC?"Charter: "Florida Statute 605.0407 states that an LLC is member-managed unless the articles of organization explicitly state otherwise. Here is how each structure impacts your control..."4.

We do not play in the mud.
