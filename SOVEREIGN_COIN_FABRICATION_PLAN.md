# Sovereign Access Coin: Fabrication Plan

## 1. Material Selection (Critical for "Premium Feel")

Avoid standard Glossy PLA. It looks and feels cheap. Use one of the following:

### **Option A: Matte Carbon Fiber PLA (Recommended)**

- **Why:** The carbon fiber flecks hide layer lines completely. The finish is a stunning matte black/charcoal that feels like military hardware.
- **Brand:** Bambu Lab PLA-CF or eSun PLA-CF.
- **Aesthetic:** "Stealth Tech" / "Obsidian".

### **Option B: Metallic/Silk PLA (Bronze or Copper)**

- **Why:** Imitates metal. If you print heavy, it tricks the brain.
- **Brand:** Amolen Bronze or Eryone Silk Copper.
- **Aesthetic:** "Antique/Legacy".

## 2. Adding "Heft" (The Weight Hack)

Plastic is too light. A 40mm plastic coin weighs ~5g. A metal challenge coin weighs ~30-40g.
To bridge this gap, we must embed weight _inside_ the print.

### **The "Pause & Insert" Technique**

1.  **Design:** Create an internal cavity in the 3D model (e.g., a 25mm x 2mm slot).
2.  **Slicer:** Set a "Pause at Layer Height" just before the cavity is roofed over.
3.  **Execution:**
    - Print starts.
    - Printer pauses at ~3mm height.
    - **Drop in a US Quarter (5.67g)** or a **large steel washer**.
    - Apply a dab of glue stick to the top of the inserted metal (helps the next layer stick).
    - Resume print. The plastic seals the metal inside forever.
4.  **Result:** A plastic coin that "thuds" when dropped.

## 3. The "Screw-Top Vault" Design (Secure & Interactive)

Instead of an exposed code, we will hide it _inside_ the coin. The user must unscrew the face to reveal the secret.

### **The Mechanism (Slim Profile)**

- **Goal:** A total thickness of **6mm** (3mm Base + 3mm Cap) so it feels like a heavy coin, not a container.
- **Thread Profile:** **ISO Metric M45 x 1.5mm pitch**.
  - _Why this size?_ The larger diameter allows for a finer 1.5mm pitch, saving vertical space while maintaining printability.
- **Tolerance:** 0.2mm air gap.

### **Part A: The Base (The Secret Keeper)**

- **Outer Diameter:** **50mm** (Large Medallion Size).
- **Thickness:** 3.0mm.
- **Feature:** Male threads on the perimeter wall.
- **Internal Recess:** A 30mm x 30mm square indentation (0.4mm deep) for the sticker.

### **Part B: The Cap (The Shield)**

- **Outer Diameter:** **50mm**.
- **Thickness:** 3.0mm.
- **Feature:** Female threads on the inner wall.
- **Top Face:** Logo raised 0.4mm (lower profile).
- **Edge:** **Fine Knurling**.

## 4. Fabrication Settings (Critical for Threads)

Printing threads requires precision.

- **Layer Height:** **0.12mm or 0.16mm** (Fine). Do NOT use 0.28mm; the threads will be blocky and rough.
- **Infill:** 100% (Solid). We need mass and strength.
- **Seam Position:** **"Random"**. An aligned seam creates a ridge that will jam the threads.
- **Material:** **Matte PLA-CF** (Carbon Fiber) is excellent here. The matte finish hides layer lines, and the carbon fiber adds rigidity to the threads.

### **Assembly Instructions**

1.  Print Base and Cap.
2.  **Sanding:** Lightly sand the top of the threads with 400-grit paper to remove any zits/blobs.
3.  **Lubrication:** Rub a tiny bit of **candle wax** or **PTFE lubricant** on the threads.
4.  **Work the Threads:** Screw it on and off 10-20 times. The friction will polish the plastic surfaces to a smooth fit.
5.  **Apply QR Code:** Stick the code inside the Base.
6.  **Close:** Screw the Cap on tight.

**Result:** A heavy, knurled, black artifact that feels like a piece of spy gear. Access requires _intent_.

## 5. Agent Steve's Recommended Workflow

1.  **Design:** Create the STL with the internal washer cavity.
2.  **Print:** Use **Matte Black PLA-CF**. Use **100% Infill** for maximum density.
3.  **Pause:** Insert a large washer at layer ~15.
4.  **Finish:**
    - Print unique QR Code stickers.
    - Apply sticker to recess.
    - Dome with UV Resin.
5.  **Ship:** Place in a small velvet pouch or a black jewelry box.

**Estimated Cost:** ~$0.50 per coin + Time.
**Perceived Value:** $50+.
