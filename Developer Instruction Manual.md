Developer Manual: Charter Legacy Technical Directives (v1.0)1. Core Architectural PhilosophyCharter Legacy is not a "chatbot" or a "form filler." It is a High-Tech Scrivener Node. The technical goal is to create a "Whole Widget" experience where complex statutory bureaucracy is distilled into a seamless, hardware-like interface.2. Visual Language & Design TokensAdherence to these tokens is non-negotiable. The app must feel like professional hardware (Apple/Tesla), not a government website.Canvas (Background): #FBFBFD (Paper White)Ink (Primary Text/Buttons): #1D1D1F (Obsidian Black)Accent (Action/Success): #007AFF (Legacy Blue)Warning (Alerts/Veto): #EF4444 (Statutory Red)Corner Radii:Primary Containers/Cards: [48px] to [56px]Input Fields/Secondary Buttons: [24px]Typography: High-legibility Sans-Serif (System font stack). Use black and bold weights for headers to signal authority.3. The Haptic Interaction ModelTo mimic physical hardware, all primary interactive elements must provide visual feedback:Token: active:scale-[0.98]Duration: transition-all duration-200Implementation: Apply to all button, input, and EntityCard components.4. AI Engine Implementation (The Charter Engine)Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash, the AI must strictly follow the Librarian Persona.A. Non-Discretionary Guardrails (UPL Safety)Filter: The ITSI (Inference-Time Self-Improvement) loop must audit every output.Forbidden Patterns: Any sentence starting with "I recommend," "You should," or "The best choice is."Mandatory Pattern: "Florida Statute 605 allows for [X]. Here is the tool to execute [X]."B. Letta Memory SystemContext Blocks: Store founder intent (e.g., "Privacy Priority: High") in local context blocks.Injection: Before any generation, inject the BusinessContext block to ensure the machine "remembers" scaling goals or family protection intents.5. Persistence & Monitoring (The Sentinel)The backend must act as an active guardian, not a passive database.Sunbiz Loop: Poll the Florida Department of State API/Web-Node every 24 hours to track entity status and annual report deadlines.FPA Pipeline: Implement an asynchronous acquisition loop for the Florida Press Association. The system must "wait" for the e-POP (Electronic Proof of Publication) and automatically vault it when detected.The Veto Buffer: Implement a hard-coded 10-day (Standard) and 15-day (Lost Key) countdown logic for all succession events.6. The Legacy Vault (Data Spec)Documents are "Artifacts," not just files.Storage: Encrypted at rest using AES-256.Tiers:Tier 1: Medical/Emergency. Instant release on verified challenge.Tier 2: Business/IRS. 10-day buffer.Tier 3: Personal/Will. 15-day buffer.Offboarding: Implement the "Freedom Key"—a single-click export that generates a ZIP containing all PDFs, JSON metadata, and Letta memory logs.7. Operational Nodes (The Bootstrap)RA API Integration: Connect to the white-label API nodes of Registered Agent wholesalers.Mapping: Article II and III in all XML submissions must default to the DeLand Hub address provided in the llc_simplification_logic.md.Directive: "Precision over features. Quality over speed. Build the bicycle."
