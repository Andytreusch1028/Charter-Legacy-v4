Protocol: Succession Access & Veto Logic (v1.0)1. Executive SummaryThe Succession Protocol is the safety mechanism that governs the transition of the "Bicycle" from the Founder to the Successor. It is designed to solve the "Sudden Absence" problem while preventing unauthorized "Breach Folklore" through a timed, tiered release system.2. The Multi-Factor Entry PathA. The Succession Key (Standard Path)The Artifact: A 16-character alphanumeric key generated by the Founder.The Trigger: Successor enters the key into the SuccessorEntryPortal.jsx.The Buffer: Turning the key initiates a 10-Day Statutory Veto Buffer.The Logic: The system assumes the key was shared intentionally, but still requires a "Cooling-off" period to prevent duress-based entries.B. The DeLand Node Override (In Extremis Path)The Scenario: Key is lost or was never shared (e.g., sudden accident).The Trigger: Successor contacts the DeLand Hub (Admin Console).The Evidence: Manual upload of a Death Certificate, Letters of Administration, or Power of Attorney.The Buffer: Admin triggers a 15-Day Extended Veto Buffer.3. The Veto Sentinel (Dead Man's Switch)A. Instant AlertsUpon any key-turn or override attempt, the system dispatches high-priority signals:SMS: "ALARM: A Succession Key for [Entity] has been turned. Access will be granted in 10 days. If this is a mistake, tap [Veto Link]."Email: Institutional security alert with the Successor’s IP and timestamp.Push Notification: Persistent "Breach Alert" banner on the Founder's mobile app.B. The "Root Veto"The Founder maintains absolute "Root Authority." A single tap on the Veto button:Immediately kills the Successor's active session.Deactivates the current Succession Key.Locks the vault for a 48-hour "Post-Breach" review period.4. Tiered Data Release (Post-Buffer)The Vault does not dump all data at once. Release is gated by the expiration of the buffer:TierAsset TypeTimingTier 1Medical Directives / Health POAInstant (Upon Key Turn + Identity Check)Tier 2Articles, EIN, Operating AgreementsDay 11 (After Buffer expires)Tier 3Personal Memos, Wills, Asset KeysDay 16 (For In Extremis cases)5. UPL GuardrailThe system provides clerical access to stored documents. It does not perform a "Probate Analysis" or provide legal advice on the validity of the transition. We are the Vault Keeper, not the Executor.Institutional Directive: "Privacy for the living. Precision for the legacy."
