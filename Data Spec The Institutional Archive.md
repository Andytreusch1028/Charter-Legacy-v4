Data Spec: The Institutional Archive (v1.0)1. Architectural VisionThe Legacy Vault is not a "cloud storage" folder. It is an Institutional Archive designed for multi-generational durability. It serves as the single source of truth for the entity's statutory existence, governance, and the founder's personal directives.2. Document Classification (The Tier System)All artifacts stored in the Vault are assigned a Tier Level, which determines its encryption profile and succession release timing.TierAsset TypeEncryptionSuccession ReleaseTier 1Medical Directives / Health POAHigh (AES-256)Instant (Post-ID Check)Tier 2Articles of Org, EIN, Public ProofsHigh (AES-256)10-Day Veto BufferTier 3Operating Agreements, MinutesUltra (Hardware Key)10-Day Veto BufferTier 4Personal Memos, Private Intent LogsUltra (Hardware Key)15-Day In Extremis3. The "Freedom Key" (Anti-Lock-in Logic)To establish ultimate trust with the founder, the system is architected for Data Sovereignty.The Trigger: A single "Export All" command in the User Dashboard.The Process: A server-side script aggregates all vaulted PDFs, generated Markdown files, and JSON metadata into a single encrypted ZIP archive.The Philosophy: "We want the user to stay because they love the tool, not because their data is hostage."4. Letta Context AnchoringThe Vault stores more than just files; it stores Context.Memory Blocks: Every session with the Charter Engine generates a SessionArtifact.json.The Sync: These logs are vaulted alongside the legal documents.Purpose: If a successor takes over, they don't just get the "Articles"; they get the "Intent" behind why the business was formed, as captured by the AI during onboarding.5. Security Protocols (The Sentinel Guard)Encryption at Rest: All assets are encrypted using AES-256 GCM.Access Logging: Every "view" or "download" event is cryptographically signed and added to the Audit Log, visible in the Privacy Shield Dashboard.The Dead Man's Switch: If the Veto Buffer is triggered (as defined in successor_access_protocol.md), the system initiates a rolling decryption of Tier 2 assets only after the 240-hour timer expires.6. Retention & RedundancyStatutory Minimum: 7 years (per Florida record-keeping folklore).Institutional Standard: Lifetime + 20 years.Physical Backup: Users are encouraged to download the "Freedom Key" ZIP and store it on a physical hardware drive in the DeLand Hub provided Master Box.Institutional Directive: "The vault is the evidence of a life well-built. Treat every bit as a sacred artifact."
