Strategy: The Operating Agreement Scrivener (v1.0)1. The Strategy: Convenience, Not CounselThe Operating Agreement (OA) is the most "high-folklore" document in Florida business. Founders are often told they "need" complex custom agreements, which creates "Thinking Jail."Charter Legacy disrupts this by providing a high-fidelity Statutory Template that maps directly to the founder's stated intent.2. The Librarian Model (UPL Safeguard)The Engine never says: "You should use this agreement."Instead, it acts as a High-Tech Librarian:The Query: "I see you listed yourself as the only member in Article IV."The Reflection: "Florida law allows for a Single-Member Operating Agreement to define your governance. Would you like to use the Charter Standard Template for this structure?"The Guardrail: The machine only populates the template after an active user "Yes" confirmation.3. Letta Memory IntegrationWe use Letta Context Blocks to ensure the OA feels personalized without requiring new data entry.Logic: If the user mentioned a spouse or child in the "Discovery" phase, the AI flags the Succession Section of the template.Execution: "I remember you mentioned your daughter, Chloe. I have flagged the 'Successor Member' section for your review in the draft."4. The "Bicycle" TemplatesWe maintain a library of three core statutory structures based on F.S. 605:The Solo-Artisan: Optimized for the single-member LLC. Focuses on IRS "Disregarded Entity" status and basic asset separation.The Multi-Rider: Optimized for 2-5 partners. Includes standard "Deadlock" and "Transfer Restriction" clauses to prevent common folklore traps.The Managed Node: Optimized for entities where a Manager (MGR) is distinct from the Owners (AMBR).5. Visual Artifact: The Obsidian PDFThe final result must not look like a "Word Doc."Design: Every OA generated is rendered as a high-fidelity PDF using the Charter Legacy "Obsidian" style (Black headers, 12pt sans-serif text, generous whitespace).Vaulting: The document is timestamped and placed in the Legacy Vault (Tier 3), subject to the 10-day Veto Buffer during succession events.6. The "Expert Mode" TrapIf a user tries to paste in a 50-page custom agreement:The Machine Response: "Charter Legacy is a statutory scrivener. Custom legal instruments should be reviewed by an attorney. We can vault this document for you as an 'External Asset,' but our Sentinel loop will not monitor it for statutory conflicts."Institutional Directive: "We don't write the law; we just make it beautiful and easy to read."
