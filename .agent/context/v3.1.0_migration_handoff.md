# Charter Legacy v3.1.0 Migration Handoff

**Critical Context for Next Conversation**

## 1. Project State: "Unified Stability" (React Migration)

- **Status:** Landing Page SUCCESSFULLY migrated to Vite + React + Tailwind.
- **Location:** `c:\Charter-Legacy v4`
- **Core File:** `src/App.jsx` (Contains Landing Page, SpecSheet Modal, Checkout Flow).
- **Run Command:** `npm start` (Runs Vite dev server).
- **Design System:** "Obsidian Aesthetic" (Glassmorphism, Dark Modes, Lucide Icons, Inter Font).

## 2. Business Logic (Codified)

- **Refund Policy:** "No Filing = Full Refund". Documented in `refund_policy.md`.
  - If status is `PAID_PENDING_INFO`, user can cancel instantly.
- **UPL Protocol:** "No Promises, Just Tools". Documented in `.agent/workflows/upl_compliance_check.md`.
  - Avoid: "Protect", "Contract", "No Probate Guarantee".
  - Use: "Secure", "Form", "Designed to avoid probate".

## 3. The "Pay-Gate" Conversions Architecture

- **Flow:** Landing Page -> SpecSheet Modal -> Checkout (Pay) -> Console (Work).
- **Philosophy:** "Commit First, Work Later." We take payment ($399/$249) before unlocking the tedious "Wizard" forms.
- **Recovery:** If user pays but doesn't finish, we use Dashboard Cards + Emails to recover.

## 4. Current Feature Set (Implemented)

- **"Rule of Three" Packages:** Standard LLC, Medical PLLC, Contractor LLC.
- **"Succession" Add-On:** Legacy Will (distinct section).
- **Mock Checkout:** A fully interactive 4-step modal in `SpecSheet` (Details -> ID -> Payment -> Success).
- **"Mom-Proof" Language:** Features renamed to Plain English (e.g., "Private Business Address" vs "RA").

## 5. Immediate Next Steps (To-Do)

1.  **Backend Integration:** Wire the Mock Checkout to actual API endpoints (Stripe/Auth).
2.  **Console Migration:** The Console (`obsidian-zenith.html`) is still HTML. It needs to be ported to React components.
3.  **Wizard Implementation:** Build the actual forms that unlock after payment.
