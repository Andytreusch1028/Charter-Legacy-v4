## Before Creating or Modifying Any Page

1. **Read the Icon Standards**
   - Always review `.agent/ICON_STANDARDS.md` before working on UI components
   - This ensures consistent icons across the application

2. **Key Rules to Follow**
   - CRUD buttons (View/Edit/Delete): **Icon-only, 36x36px, with title tooltip**
   - Primary CTAs (Upload, Add): **Icon + Text labels**
   - Use **inline SVGs** in JavaScript (not external sprite references)
   - Page title badges: **Gold gradient background, white icon**

3. **Icon Reference**
   - Eye = View
   - Pen = Edit
   - Trash = Delete
   - Plus = Add/Create
   - Upload/Download for file actions

4. **Verification**
   - Check that all CRUD buttons match the standard format
   - Ensure page badges use the gold gradient style
   - Confirm icons render correctly (inline SVG, not external use)
