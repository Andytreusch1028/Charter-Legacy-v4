Logic: LLC Mapping & Simplification Strategy (v1.0)1. The Architectural VisionThe "Mapping Strategy" is designed to eliminate the bureaucratic friction of the Florida Articles of Organization. We stop asking for Data and start asking for Intent. The machine then scrives that intent into a bank-ready, 100% compliant statutory instrument.2. The Physical Anchor Logic (DeLand Hub)Florida requires a physical Principal Address and a Registered Agent. This is the primary point where founders trade their privacy for compliance.The Logic: We default all address fields to the DeLand Hub Node.Sunbiz Mapping:Article II (Principal Office): 123 Innovation Way, Ste 400, DeLand, FL 32720.Article II (Mailing Address): 123 Innovation Way, Ste 400, DeLand, FL 32720.Article III (Registered Agent): Charter Legacy RA Node (DeLand).Result: The founder's home address never touches the public record. We solve the "Privacy Trap" before they even realize it exists.3. Statutory Purpose Scrivening (Article VI)The state asks for a "Purpose." Standard forms often lead founders to over-explain, which can trigger accidental regulatory audits (e.g., DBPR licensing traps).The Intent: User describes their dream (e.g., "A boutique hardware shop").The Mapping: The AI appends the statutory "Catch-All" clause:"Treusch & Forge LLC is organized for the retail distribution of hardware and specialized tools, including any and all lawful business permitted under Chapter 605, Florida Statutes."Result: Maximum operational flexibility. The user doesn't have to "think" about legal definitions.4. Leadership Mapping (Article IV)Sunbiz folklore uses terms like MGR (Manager) and AMBR (Authorized Member).The Simplification: We ask, "Who is the lead on this journey?"The Default: The user is mapped as AMBR (Member-Managed).Expert Mode: Only if a user explicitly adds "Professional Management" do we shift the mapping to MGR.UPL Safeguard: We don't advise on which is "better." we present the "Solo-Founder Standard" as the default path for administrative simplicity.5. The Effective Date ProtocolFounders often worry about when their business "starts" for tax purposes.The Rule: Default to Date of Filing.The Exception: If the filing occurs between November 1 and December 31, the machine offers a "Tax Optimization Switch" to set the Effective Date to January 1 of the following year.Result: Prevents unnecessary tax filing requirements for a business that existed for only 3 weeks in the prior year.6. The "Whole Widget" ExportOnce the mapping is complete, the machine doesn't just send data to the state; it wraps the data in a high-fidelity Charter Artifact.Vaulting: The JSON intent is stored in the Legacy Vault alongside the official PDF.Data Sovereignty: If the user leaves, they take the "Map" with them, not just the "Form."Institutional Directive: "We are the high-tech librarian. We do not choose the destination; we provide the most efficient map to get there."
