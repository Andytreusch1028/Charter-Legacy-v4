# Charter Legacy - Core Goal

Charter Legacy is not merely a document generator; it is a high-tech scrivener platform designed to transform bureaucratic entity formation into an elegant, privacy-first experience. By leveraging the "Florida Hub" architecture, we eliminate the "courage tax" of starting a business, providing institutional-grade legal infrastructure with the precision of high-end hardware.

Beyond formation, we automate the preservation of family and business continuity through the Succession Suite and Legacy Timer. We believe that a founder’s impact should outlive their physical location, and through our "Freedom Key" protocol and zero-knowledge storage, we ensure that the Digital Soul of the enterprise remains sovereign, secure, and seamlessly transferable to the next generation.
